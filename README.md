## Known Issues

Currently, transient prompt in fish shell is still in experimental state with a few known bugs. The very solution comes from [Oh My Posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/src/shell/scripts/omp.fish), while still containing some minor issues.

* Transient prompt is **NOT** working in vi binding mode
* Current solution is by repainting former prompt instantly whenever `\r` is sent, so it's not able to update from the pipe status afterwards
* Same as above, while receiving `^C` it does not repaint properly
